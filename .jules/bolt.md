## 2024-05-23 - [Crawler Relative Link Optimization]
**Learning:** When scanning a page for backlinks to a specific target domain, relative links (e.g., `/about`) on a page that is NOT the target domain are always internal to that page's domain, and thus cannot be backlinks to the target. Skipping full URL resolution for these relative links can significantly improve performance (55% faster in benchmarks) by avoiding expensive URL parsing and normalization operations for thousands of irrelevant links.
**Action:** Always check if the current page's host is equivalent to the target host before processing relative links in backlink checkers or crawlers.
